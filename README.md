# Rock Paper Scissors Quiz

This is a small single view app that turns the old rock paper scissors game into a small cognitive game. The app tells you the condition, for example, *the app chooses rock and wins*. The user has to select the correct button (either rock, paper or scissors) to match the condition.

This small project is part of my journey to learn Swift and SwiftUI and builds upon my existing knowlegde from the projects *iFlag* and *iSplit*. The following list introduces the key topics in learning by creating this app.

- Custom View Modifiers with `ViewModifier`
- Adding the custom view modifier as an `extension View`
- ForEach
